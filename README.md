# Advanced Analytics Applications in IoT (WIP)


Imagine the days of no online shopping or convenience of calling for a cab online or unable to check 
the weather for the day online or find the route to drive home. Internet of things (IoT) has advanced 
in several areas of our lives like say Manufacturing, Healthcare, Social media, Commerce etc., Also in
areas that impact our Personal and Social lives like Weather, Connected homes and soon Connected cars, 
stores and even elevators are connected or being connected. It has helped us not just in improving service
but in sustaining food and resource production for increasing population on earth.
  
  
The real benefit of IoT comes not just with inter connecting more and more devices but in our ability
to harness this data to take quicker decisions leading to accurate and timely actions.
In this regard, there is a gap and so an exciting opportunity to Analyze this Data flood.
  
Analytics has become a key driving factor to define the success of a company irrespective of either the Business 
is a Corporate or a Boutique startup.
  
The challenges we will face include how to effectively utilize Advanced Analytics with this Overwhelming data and
prioritizing their application areas. Lets have a look at the areas of applications and it effectiveness for 
effort invested.
  
  
IoT implementations can be seen from a Systems perspective cutting across domain areas. 
The Applications of Advanced Analytics are far too any and impacts all areas starting from data inception,
consumption to mining foresights from the data.
    
  
Before we start discussing further on this topic, we need to distinguish between Business intelligence systems
and Analytics systems.
  
  
Objective of Business intelligence systems are to churn out Management Reports in the form of Adhoc reports,
Structured or Fixed / Canned reports that can be consumed by Management or Operations on the floor. Reports will
also include Push or pull notifications like SMS, email etc.,
  
Analytics starts where Business Intelligence ends with the key distinction being complexity of calculations performed
and the outcomes by leveraging mathematical based models.
  
  
Broadly the application areas of Advanced Analytics in IoT can be seen as below in the order of the journey of the
data from source to consumption and its complexity
  
  
1.	Analytics location
2.	Rule based deviation detection
3.	Anomaly detection
4.	Change point detection
5.	Predictive system behavior
6.	Edge Analytics
  
Advanced Analytics for IoT can be classified based on
1.	Nature of deployment in a System: Where in the Data flow of the system is the Calculation logic
    or Engine deployed
2.	Complexity of Advanced Analytics calculations: How complex or Advanced these algorithms used for 
    the calculations are.

* 1. [Rule based deviation detection] is a basic application of Analytics in IoT wherein the interaction between
a set of parametric values are related to the outcome of another parameter within the system. These parametric
values are nothing but data read from sensors mounted on various IoT subsystems like Temperature Pressure etc.,

These rules are knowledge acquired by SMEs about the system which is translated and embedded as code for raising 
an alert or alarm when the conditions are met.
  
  
On demand Rule based deviations can be detected using BI reports or Applications with UI to configure these rules.
  
  
* 2. [Anomaly detection] is a step up where in using Statistical techniques, a deviation from the normal operating
ranges of an equipment is identified and alerts are raised. Anomaly can be due to a single parameter or a 
combination of parametric values which are out of wack.
  
  
* 3. Next higher in the order of complexity is [Change point detection] wherein a statistically driven algorithm
detects a Change in performance of the system. Change point detection is often confused for Rule based 
deviation detection. The primary distinction is that Change point detects any permanent departure in the 
performance of a system while a Rule based change detection detects a point in time change which might fall 
back to normal range

* 4.	One of the advanced applications of Analytics in IoT is Predicting systems behavior. These can be either
Forecasting techniques that use Time series models. Or a combination of Time series forecasting and Multivariate 
event driven Predictive models can be used. The Target for Prediction can be linear values (like Temperature) 
or binary conditions (Failure Yes/No condition)
